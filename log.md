### Day 2 8/6/19

**Today's Progress**: ~30 minutes Odin Project, Library project

**Thoughts:** I feel like I got myself stuck in the weeds pretty quickly here. Going to sketch it out later and make sure I understand everything. Felt so tired today, but wanted to commit something

  - [Project: Book Library](https://github.com/gracewitter/100DaysOfCode-Round2/tree/master/Javascript/Odin/organising-js/project-library)

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed the vue lesson, still seems pretty simple. I needed to map out the library project on paper before I could mentally understand all of the parts, but I'm really happy that I got there. Not feeling bothered to add any css to make it look nice.
