# 100DaysOfCode-Round2
2nd iteration of 100 Days Of Code challenge

I really loved my first 100 days challenge because the structure meant that I could commit to making progress every day, and it was fantastic to see the cumultive sum of my efforts. I stopped about halfway through because I got a new job and shifted my focus there. 

Now that I'm happily settled in with my work, I want to go back and revisit this challenge. I know that I need to learn Vue.js and deepen my understanding of javascript for work, so it makes sense for me to start there. I have a vue course on udemy that I'm working on, and I want to work through the javascript lessons in the odin project and javascript.info. Once I'm happy with that, I have a couple of courses that I never actually finished, so I would love to go back and finally complete those. 

So that's the plan! I'll write a summary here every 10 days and will also keep a [daily log](https://github.com/gracewitter/100DaysOfCode-Round2/blob/master/log.md)
